# Replication

Data replication is a planned feature and not implemented yet. At the moment, data replication can be achieved by using a persistence adapter for Supabase, Appwrite, Firebase or RxDB and using their replication functionality.

* [RxDB Persistence Adapter](/data-persistence/rxdb/)
* [Firebase Persistence Adapter](/data-persistence/firebase/)
* [Appwrite Persistence Adapter](/data-persistence/appwrite/)
* [Supabase Persistence Adapter](/data-persistence/supabase/)

You can discuss the implementation of replication in the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/maxnowack/signaldb/issues/395).
