# RxDB Persistence Adapter

You can replicate your data with external systems if you persist your data in [RxDB](https://rxdb.info). In our [example](https://github.com/maxnowack/signaldb/tree/main/example) is a crude example of a persistence adapter to RxDB. It's not optimized, but it works. You'll find it [here](https://github.com/maxnowack/signaldb/blob/main/example/src/system/setupCollection/persistence.ts).
